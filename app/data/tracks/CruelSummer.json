      "summary": "\"Cruel Summer\" is about a tumultuous relationship between two people, set against a summer backdrop. The lyrics tell the story of someone who is desperately in love, who has to sneak away from their protective family to be with their love, and how that love is both exhilarating and painful. Despite the feeling of uncertainty and potential hurt, the singer is hopeful that their love will conquer even the most difficult odds and that their relationship will survive. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Cruel+Summer\"\u003ERead more on Last.fm\u003C/a\u003E.",

Despite the feeling of uncertainty and potential hurt, the singer is hopeful that their love will conquer even the most difficult odds and that their relationship will survive. The chorus, \"It's a cruel summer / But I'll tell 'em it's cool\", serves as a metaphor for the relationships complexity, as the singer seeks comfort in the idea that, despite everything, their love is worth it. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Cruel+Summer\"\u003ERead more on Last.fm\u003C/a\u003E.
