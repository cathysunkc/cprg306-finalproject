In context with the anime, it reflects the main character Lain Iwakura’s struggles with understanding the world around her and her wish for a helping hand. Out of context, it depicts a relationship between her and another guy who turns out to be very different from what he seemed to be at first.\n\nIt’s the band’s most popular song, and subsequently one of the most beloved opening themes among longtime anime fans. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/b%C3%B4a/_/Duvet\"\u003ERead more on Last.fm\u003C/a\u003E.
