He expresses both the positive and negative aspects of fame, from the freedom and excitement of living like a celebrity, to the loneliness of being recognized everywhere and never able to escape it. The song also expresses nostalgia for simpler times, when things were not so overwhelming and difficult. The chorus serves as a warning to the listener, asking them to consider the consequences of seeking the fame that Kanye now has. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/_/Flashing+Lights\"\u003ERead more on Last.fm\u003C/a\u003E.
