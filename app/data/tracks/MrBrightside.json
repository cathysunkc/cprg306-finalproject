The song is featured on the group's debut album Hot Fuss and was written by Brandon Flowers and Dave Keuning.\n\nIt was named \"Song of the Decade\" by UK radio stations Absolute Radio and XFM, and in April 2010 Last.fm revealed that it was the most listened to track since the launch of the online music service, with over 12.2 million plays scrobbled. It held the record until 2020 when BTS broke the record with  \"Boy With Luv\". \n\nIn October 2010, it was voted ninth in the Greatest Guitar Riffs of the 21st Century so far by Total Guitar magazine. It is The Killers' best-selling song in the US where it has sold over 3 million copies.\n\nLyrically, Mr. Brightside depicts the jealousy and paranoia of a male who suspects his significant other is deliberately cheating on him. The song is inspired by an unfaithful ex-girlfriend of frontman Brandon Flowers. Dave Keuning composed the verses to this song before meeting Flowers, Flowers wrote lyrics and composed the chorus after hearing Dave's ideas. \n\nIn the November of the year 2001, the group had recorded Mr. Brightside along with three other demos including Desperate, Replaceable, and Under the Gun at Mike Sak's Kill the Messenger Studio in Henderson, Nevada. \nThey handed out this demo for free during their shows in the year 2002. The song was first officially released in 2003, and achieved more success when it was re-released in 2004. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Mr.+Brightside\"\u003ERead more on Last.fm\u003C/a\u003E.
