By the end of the verse, he realizes nothing else matters but waking up next to her every morning.\n\nStretching one’s hands out is a common image of prayer and supplication. As in the opening sample, Kanye is expressing a desire to submit to God’s will despite his own pride.\n\nThis song is one of the songs that popularized Metro’s tag.\n\n\"What has Chance the Rapper, who is a credited writer, said about the song?\"\n\nIn an interview with Complex, Chance was asked if he wrote the “bleached asshole” line. After replying that he hadn’t written the line, Chance said the following:\n\n\"‘Ye is a comedian in a lot of ways. He writes stuff that is painfully funny and painfully true. And that’s why you respect comedy and that’s why you respect his work. His best lines are lines that are just funny, whether it’s, like, a word being mispronounced, or a weird take on something that a lot of people wouldn’t necessarily say out loud—not making light of [it], but in a clever way exposing something that’s socially wrong, you know?'\"\n\n“Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1” was certified 3x platinum by the RIAA on September 23rd, 2020. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/_/Father+Stretch+My+Hands+Pt.+1\"\u003ERead more on Last.fm\u003C/a\u003E.
